# Gravity Falls Hunt

## What is this?

This is the code that I wrote to solve a treasure hunt run by Mortius as part of their Open Arms Reaction series.

I've turned the simple code hunting into coding challenge.

## How to run

### Javascript

```shell
cd gf-js
node gfHunt.js
```

### OCAML

```shell
cd gf-ocaml
dune build
dune exec gf-ocaml
```
